# Math Syntax Checker
This project implements a graphical Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) designed to validate arithmetic math expressions. The program visually represents the DFA's state transitions while processing user input, verifying the correctness of mathematical expressions based on syntax rules. Users can input arithmetic expressions, and the DFA will either accept or reject them, highlighting the step-by-step evaluation process. This tool is useful for teaching DFA concepts and understanding mathematical expression parsing.
